<p><strong>Welcome to SAIL!</strong></p>
<p>You've just completed the first step in your journey to finding the right housing solution for your loved one. As a member of SAIL, you are able to enjoy many benefits which are outlined below.</p> 
<p>The entire SAIL family is here to help you at every step, whether you are just getting started, looking to launch your loved one in the near future, or if your loved one is already living on their own and are looking to meet new friends or find a roommate.</p> 
<p>To help you understand SAIL and all the membership benefits, SAIL hosts a monthly zoom call the 2nd Wednesday of every month at 6:30 pm to answer general questions about SAIL and to help navigate the SAIL website, https://sailhousingsolutions.org/events/    
RSVP is appreciated but not required at Info@sailhousingsolutions.org.</p> 
<p>In the meantime, visit our website,  www.SailHousingSolutions.org and explore the many areas now available to you, including:</p> 
<ul>
	<li>Housing Roadmap & Resources: This section of the site includes a comprehensive guide to help you through the process of launching a loved one, written by parents for parents.   To support the housing roadmap, SAIL has gathered and created documents that are useful and practical tools to help you create the best housing solution for your loved one with a successful and smooth transition for both parent and loved one.</li>
	<li>SAILing Lessons: SAIL believes in connecting people with people and people  with resources.  SAILing lessons are parent gatherings that follow the Housing Roadmap, where resources, success stories and information is shared to help families develop their solution.</li>
	<li>Friendship Connect: FC is SAILs effort to connect people to people. SAIL’s FC portal provides a platform where parents can create a personal profile for your loved one and search other profiles to find potential friends and roommates. </li>
	<li>Sign up for our newsletter, if you haven't done so already.  It's a great way to stay informed and to learn about our upcoming SAILing Lessons, Friendship Connect, and other educational and networking events.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a SAIL member, you will enjoy free access to SAILing Lessons and Friendship Connect Events. </p> 
<p>We look forward to helping you as you create your solution.</p>
<p>We are excited you have come aboard!</p>
