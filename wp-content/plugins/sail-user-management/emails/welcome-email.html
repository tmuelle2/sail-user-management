<p><strong>Welcome to SAIL!</strong></p><br/>
<p>You've just completed the first step in your journey to finding the right housing solution for your loved one. As a member of SAIL, you are able to enjoy the many benefits which are outlined below.</p><br/>
<p>The entire SAIL family is here to help you at every step, whether you are just getting started, looking to launch your loved one in the near future, or if your loved one is already living on their own and are looking to meet new friends or find a roommate.</p><br/> 
<p>SAIL believes in connecting people to people and people to resources and that all roads lead back to the SAIL Housing Roadmap.</p><br/>
<p>Visit our website, www.SailHousingSolutions.org and explore the many areas now available to you, including:</p><br/> 
<ul>
	<li>Housing Roadmap & Resources: This section of the site includes a comprehensive guide to help you through the process of launching a loved one, written by parents for parents.   To support the housing roadmap, SAIL has gathered useful documents and has created  practical tools to help you create the best housing solution for your loved one with a successful and smooth transition for both parent and loved one. </li>
	<li>SAILing Lessons: SAIL believes in connecting people to  resources.  SAILing lessons are parent gatherings that follow the Housing Roadmap, where resources, success stories and information is shared to help families develop their solution.</li>
	<li>Friendship Connect: FC is SAILs effort to connect people to people. SAIL’s FC portal provides a platform where parents can create a personal profile for their loved one and search other profiles to find potential friends and roommates.</li>
